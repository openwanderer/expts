OpenWanderer Experiments
========================

Experiments with various technologies to be used by OpenWanderer and OpenTrailView 4.


Currently:

- `comp_vis`: Anything computer vision related, primarily face and car/license plate detection.
- `osm`: Code to attempt to integrate the OpenTrailView OSM-based navigation into OpenWanderer. Leaving separate for now, to keep things clean I want to focus on sequence-based navigation.
- `ganav`: code based on Eesger's new navigation system. Not fully integrated yet
