# Experiments with altitude, markers and polylines

This code was developed from [OpenPanos](https://github.com/nickw1/openpanos) and is an experiment, partially using Eesger Toering's coordinate system transformation code (in `coordtrans.js`) to render the locations of nearby panoramas, and the route to them, as markers and polylines in spherical coordinates with elevation taken into account.

This code will not be directly be used in openwanderer but will be used to help develop the client API.
